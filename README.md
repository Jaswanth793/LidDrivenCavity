# LidDrivenCavity
Final Project for the AM5630: Foundation of Computational Fluid Dynamics Course.  

I have utilized the Streamfunction-Vorticity Formulation to solve the Navier-Stokes Equations using finite difference methods, such as upwind schemes and central difference schemes, to achieve accurate results and better capture of the physics.
