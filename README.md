# LidDrivenCavity
Final Project for the AM5630: Foundation of Computational Fluid Dynamics Course.  

I have used the Streamfunction-Vorticity Formulation to solve the Navier-Stokes Equations using Finite Difference Methods like upwind schemes and central difference schemes for accurate results and better capturing of the physics.
